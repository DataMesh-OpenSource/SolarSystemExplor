We previously made two versions of our SolarSystemExplorer: PC and HoloLens versions. We also deployed our Solar System Explorer on our device. 

All we have to do now is to see the two version work and especially, work together. 

- Start your MeshExpertCenter. 

- Open you Solar System Explorer PC version and Play it. 

- Get your HoloLens and run the Solar System Explorer you deployed previously. Wait for it to start on HoloLens. *If you have other devices, start the application on those
  devices too.*

If you've done things correctly, you must be able to interact with the application on HoloLens and see your
movement on your PC version and vice versa. 

And that's it! You have an application with Collaboration Module working. 

You can now share your holographic experience with other users!! It is enough to install your HoloLens version on other HoloLens devices. Have in mind that you can deploy only on a number of devices
that is permitted by your [license](https://license.datamesh.com).
